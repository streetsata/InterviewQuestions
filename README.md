### *OOP concepts*

What are the basic principles of OOP? How are they implemented in C#?
> `Encapsulation`: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
> `Inheritance`: Allowing a class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass).
> `Polymorphism`: Objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass.
