<summary>What are the basic principles of OOP? How are they implemented in C#?</summary>

<ul>
  <li>Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).</li>
  <li>Inheritance: Allowing a class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass).</li>
  <li>Polymorphism: Objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass.</li>
</ul>
